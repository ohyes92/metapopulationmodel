# metapopulationmodel
The model is an incidence function model open source code.

This model is the code for the IFM-LCONS model, which combines the incidence function model with landscape connectivity.

For the SDM (Species Distribution Modeling) model, species occurrence data and environmental data are required. This code is written in a simplified form. If you need additional environmental variable data and species occurrence data, please request it by emailing mr.solver92@snu.ac.kr, and I will share the data with you.
